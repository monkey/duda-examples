Duda I/O Examples: 080 Dthread Fibonacci
========================================
On this example we will show how to use the dthread (duda thread)
provided by duda to write synchronous-like code and communication
between different dthreads with channel.

There is a productor dthread which constructs the first twenty
numbers of the fibonacci sequence, and a consumer dthread that
picks up every generated number from the productor dthread and
sends back to the user. In order to access it you may type the
following address:

  http://localhost:2001/dthread_fibonacci/

For more details about the service please refer to the source code.
